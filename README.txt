Welcome to the RACE! created by Sam Edmonds
In this game you are the manager of a racing team.
You must develop a driver and a car to defeat your opponents!
Your driver and car have stats which will be compared to the enemy teams stats at races.
The stats are the drivers: fitness, intelligence, and skill and the cars: motor, aerodynamics, structure.
All of the stats start at level 6. Opponents are random, but harder difficulties increase them.
There is a race every Sunday and between them you will improve your driver and car, get sponsers, and spy on your opponents.
You also have a bank account and you gain money from winning races and from sponserships.
On Easy mode you start with $1500, Normal $1000, and Hard $500.
This money will be used to develop your car and to scout opponents.
Between races you can do one of the following things each day, some of which cost money:
