Welcome to the RACE! created by Sam Edmonds
In this game you are the manager of a racing tean.
You must develop a driver and a car to defeat your opponents!
Your driver and car have stats which will be compared to the enemy teams stats at races.
There is a race every Sunday and between them you will improve your driver and team.
You also have a bank account and you gain money from winning races and from sponserships.
This money will be used to develop your car and to scout opponents.
Between races you can do one of the following things each day:
1. Develop driver:

    b. Send driver to watch film
    c. Send driver to practice driving
2 Develop car:
    a. Upgrade car motor
    b. Upgrade car aerodynamics
    c. Upgrade car structure
3. Scout out your opponents
4. Manage Sponsorships
    a. view sponsors
    b. get a new sponsor
    c. create a sponsored video with driver (decreasing drivers stats)
As the manager you don't control the car or crew during the race.
